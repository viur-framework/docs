Getting started
###############

This part of the documentation provides a first steps guide for quickly setting up an application with ViUR. The following chapters will go much deeper into ViUR, its architecture and how it is used. The Google App Engineâ„¢ is only introduced shortly here. Knowledge on what it is, how it works and how an application is registered there is required, before continuing.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

ViUR runs on top of the Google App Engine (GAE). This means, that a ViUR application needs to be deployed to the Google Cloud Platform when it is run on the internet. For the deployment as well as a local development and testing environment, Google offers the `Google App Engine SDK for Python <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python>`_.

There are two ways to get the SDK run on your machine:

1. Manually download and install the SDK natively from the above location for your particular operating system. Windows, Mac OS and Linux are supported. In case that Linux is used, the particular package manager should be consulted first, maybe it already supports packages for the Google App Engine SDK for Python.

  It is also required to have a working **Python 2.7** installation on your machine. This can be obtained from `python.org <https://www.python.org>`_, but may be pre-installed already when you are on Linux or Mac OS.

2. If you are familiar with Docker, we also offer several *ViUR docker recipes* to quickly set up a dedicated, Linux-based build-environment, with all prerequisites installed. To make use of these, just visit `<https://hub.docker.com/u/viur/>`_.

====================
Create a new project
====================

The ways described here only provide basic stubs for a fresh ViUR project to start from.

Setting up a new ViUR project is easy, and takes only a few steps for getting a working result. Make sure that the :ref:`Prerequisites` described above are installed so far, and Python is in your PATH.

-----------
Quick start
-----------

1. Create an empty project folder of your choice in a location of your choice. Change into this location.

2. Download the latest **setup.py** `here <https://www.viur.is/package/download/setup/latest>`_.

3. Run ``python setup.py``. On Windows, just double-clicking the file ``setup.py`` should do the job.

4. The setup utility determines the project name from the project directory. This should be the same name as the unique application identifier registered for the application on GAE, if deploying is wanted. Enter a project-name or confirm the default one.

5. Confirm the installation when the correct folder is prompted. The setup utility then will write all necessary files and download the current server and vi.

Then, you're done! The app can now be locally run with ``dev_appserver.py -A <your-app-id> .`` from the terminal (Linux, Mac OS) or from the *Google App Engine Launcher* (Windows, Mac OS). By default, the app runs on port 8080 (`<http://localhost:8080>`_), or with the port provided by the *Google App Engine Launcher*.

Below is an example for a few commands on a Linux terminal prompt to set up a clean ViUR project from scratch:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Setup project folder
   mkdir hello-viur

   # Change into folder
   cd hello-viur

   # Download latest setup
   wget -qO setup.py https://www.viur.is/package/download/setup/latest

   # Run ViUR setup tool
   python setup.py

   # Start Google App Engine
   dev_appserver.py -A hello-viur .


When you see a friendly "Hello World" welcoming you in your browser, your app is running!
The Vi can be access at `<http://localhost:8080/vi>`_, or under your particular port.

-------------------------
Using the base repository
-------------------------

For a professional project setup, we recommend to use our pre-configured base repository, which can be found at `<https://github.com/viur-framework/base>`_. This repository can be used for a ViUR project setup that imports the required ViUR modules like server and vi as submodules into the repository, so they can easily be updated to newer versions and supplied bugfixes.

Simply clone it and afterwards run ``clean-base.py`` to obtain a stand-alone repository which can immediately be executed and pushed elsewhere.

These are the commands to be executed on a Linux terminal prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone base repository
   git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/base.git hello-viur

   # Change into folder
   cd hello-viur

   # Run clean-base.py
   python clean-base.py

   # Commit changes done
   git commit -a

   # Run development server
   ./local_run.sh

See the README-file of the repo for further help!

---------------
The first login
---------------

On the first startup, ViUR creates an new admin-user named ``admin@<your-app-id>.appspot.com`` with a random password within the database. This password is printed to the server debug console, where you have to copy it out.

Watch out for a line that looks like this:
::
   ViUR created a new admin-user for you! Username: admin@myapp.appspot.com, Password: SU7juUIb1F2aZ

When the system is started in the cloud for the first time, an e-mail with this password is sent to all application administrators.

Alternatively, you can login with a simulated Google user. Both login forms are provided by the default server and can be done using the Vi.
